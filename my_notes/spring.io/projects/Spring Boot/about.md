Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

If you’re looking for information about a specific version, or instructions about how to upgrade from an earlier release, check out the project release notes section on our wiki.
